## MLM_Project_2_Supervised_Learning

In this project we used Bank Customer details that we have segmented using K-means Machine Learning clustering algorithm and applied various supervised learning algorithms to classify the features in the data and find the optimal algorithm and its important features. Also, provided insights on how bank can use tailored bank strategies for different classes.
